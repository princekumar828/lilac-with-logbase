Key Configuration Details
log_format: '<Content>' This is the most important setting. It tells LILAC to treat the entire log line as the content to be parsed, which is correct for these LogBase datasets since they don't have a complex, structured prefix like HDFS or OpenStack logs.

regex: [r'(\d+\.){3}\d+', r'\d+'] I've added a couple of generic regular expressions as a starting point. These will help the parser identify and mask common parameters like IP addresses and numbers, which can improve accuracy. You can refine these later for each specific dataset if needed.

st (Similarity Threshold) and depth: I've used standard default values (0.4 and 4). These are good starting points, but you may want to tune them for specific datasets later to optimize performance.
