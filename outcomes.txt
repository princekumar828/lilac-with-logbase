The poor performance persists because:

Sampling Quality Issue: The 8-shot examples for brave dataset are still poor quality
Fundamental LogBase Complexity: LogBase datasets are inherently more complex than traditional system logs
LILAC's Design Limitations: LILAC was designed for structured system logs, not diverse application logs

Systematic Improvement Strategy
Test 32-shot for Better Coverage


32-shot Results for brave dataset:

Grouping Accuracy (GA): 57.98% vs 58% (8-shot) - essentially identical
Parsing Accuracy (PA): 27.70% vs 37% (8-shot) - significant drop
PTA: 16.98% vs 18% (8-shot) - slightly worse
Templates Generated: 53 vs 29 ground truth
Key Observations:

Unexpected Results: 32-shot performed worse than 8-shot, particularly in Parsing Accuracy (27.7% vs 37%)

Over-Template Generation: Created 53 templates vs 29 ground truth, indicating the model is creating too many specific templates rather than generalizing well

Template Quality Issues: I noticed several "ChatGPT template wrong: cannot match itself" messages, showing the LLM is generating invalid templates

Pattern Over-Specificity: The 32-shot approach seems to be making templates too specific (e.g., very detailed regex patterns for headers) rather than finding good generalizations

Found the problem! The sampling examples have serious quality issues:

Duplicates: Multiple identical query-answer pairs (e.g., "error handling end [settings] 0.9" appears twice)
Inconsistent Templates:
Same content maps to different templates: "Invalid input: more than 4 fields exist in line 12" vs "Invalid input: more than 4 fields exist (expected 3)" both map to "Invalid input: more than 4 fields exist {variables}"
Some templates are too generic: "{variables}Invalid input: {variables} is too long"
Poor Generalization: Templates like "Ignoring request to add > {variables} dynamic entries {variables}" are too specific








1. Inconsistent Template Examples
The 16-shot file contains inconsistent templating:
Good examples:

{"query": "Running for 6 minutes now.", "answer": "Running for {variables} minutes now."}
Bad examples (inconsistent):

{"query": "This task runs for 15 minutes", "answer": "This task runs for 15 minutes"}
{"query": "Assume this is a setup task", "answer": "Assume this is a setup task"}

☝️ These should have been templated but weren't!

2. Over-generalization Issues
Some templates are too aggressive:

{"query": "3 report successfully exported to monthly_report.pdf.", "answer": "{variables} {variables} successfully exported to {variables}."}

The word "report" should probably stay as literal text, not become {variables}.

3. LLM Confusion from Mixed Signals
When the LLM sees both:

"15 minutes" → stays literal
"6 minutes" → becomes {variables}
It gets confused about when to apply templating rules.

4. Sampling Algorithm Issues
The sampling algorithm that selected 16 examples included:

Low-quality examples that should be templated but aren't
Conflicting patterns that confuse the LLM
Over-representation of certain patterns
Solutions:
Updated todo list

Immediate Fixes:
Stick with 8-shot for now (it's performing better)
Improve sampling quality rather than quantity
Fix the inconsistent examples in the sampling algorithm
Better Approach:
Instead of increasing shot count, focus on:

Example quality: Ensure consistent templating
Pattern coverage: Better selection of representative examples
Preprocessing: Handle markup tags before templating
The lesson here is: More examples ≠ Better performance if the examples are inconsistent or confusing to the LLM.

The issue is clear: the hierarchical clustering algorithm is producing duplicate examples and inconsistent templates

The Core Problem: Incorrect Ground Truth Format
Your renaming of the files is a good start, but the internal structure of the files is different.

LILAC's Expected _structured.csv Format: The LILAC evaluator (evaluator_main.py) requires a CSV with these four columns: LineId,Content,EventId,EventTemplate

EventId: A unique ID for each template (e.g., E1, E2, E3). All log lines with the same template must have the same EventId.
LogBase's GeneralAnnotation.csv Format: This file typically only has three columns: LineId,Content,EventTemplate It is missing the EventId column, which is crucial for the "Grouping Accuracy" (GA) metric. Without it, the evaluator cannot correctly group log messages, leading to extremely poor scores.

The Solution: Generate the Correct _structured.csv
You need to create a script that reads the GeneralAnnotation.csv and generates a new _structured.csv file with the required EventId column.
